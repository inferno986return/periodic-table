A vector periodic table using flat design

Most commercial periodic table posters (at ones available in the UK) are ugly.

The goal of this project is to create a beautiful periodic table using [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/) that looks great on a screen and when printed onto A3/A2 paper.

I have modified [*The Periodic Table of the Elements in Adobe Illustrator Format*](https://www.briandalessandro.com/blog/the-periodic-table-of-the-elements-in-adobe-illustrator-format/) by Brian D'Alessandro. It has also been updated to be accurate as of May 2022, as per the reference periodic table on the [IUPAC website](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/). Along with the use of tabular numbers.

The original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file in this repository in case you don't like the direction I have gone with this.
